This is a simple proof of concept Jupyter to web-app, using a FastAI (Pytorch based) deep learning classifier of cat-pictures. It focuses on Bengal cats.

The classification is simply<br> 
*bengal / other / cartoon*

The startup of the "mybinder.org" app can take some time, so be patient. I have already generated a *mybinder* here:

Note to self:<br>
*requirements.txt* is necessaryfor mybinder to work. Also requires the tag "main" to work properly.

More edit:<br>
*export.pkl* is the model file.
*tmp.jpg* is cat picture to test if one doesn't have one handy.
