This is a simple proof of concept Jupyter to web-app, using a FastAI (Pytorch based) deep learning classifier of cat-pictures. It focuses on Bengal cats.

The classification is simply<br> 
*bengal / other / cartoon*

The startup of the "mybinder.org" app can take some time, so be patient. Enter the following:<br>
Github: https://github.com/DocMinus/bengal-ai-classifier<br>
tags: main<br>
path (url, not file): /voila/render/bengal_vs_cats_app.ipynb<br>

Note to self:<br>
*requirements.txt* is necessaryfor mybinder to work. Also requires the tag "main" to work properly.

More edit:<br>
*export.pkl* is the model file.
*tmp.jpg* is cat picture to test if one doesn't have one handy.
*update: new model file. slightly better bengal detection
*update: use of GIT LFS for large files due to pkl > 25MB
